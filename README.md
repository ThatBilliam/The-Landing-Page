# The Landing Page

A small landing page thing to help people get organized with things.
In September of 2021, I started working on this project in an attempt to organize myself before I fell behind in my junior year. Of course I fell behind anyways because I had no idea how to code. I still don't, but that's besides the point.
Despite not updating it as you think one would, this is still a passion project I find myself revisiting when I think of something to add. I hope to use this as a method of expanding my web development knowledge while helping others out.
